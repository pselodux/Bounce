# Bounce

**NOTE!** This is still a work-in-progress!

### Description
An abstract music "sequencer" inspired by [Hanenbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BexGR0OQF) from the Nintendo DS game *Electroplankton*.

Written in p5.js.

Click in the space to generate a randomly moving ball that will bounce off the lines and the sides of the screen. When the ball bounces on a line, its position on the line will correspond to a note.

### Features to come
* A way to move and add/remove the lines
* A way to remove each ball so things don't get too crowded
