# Bounce

Latest version available online [here](https://0f.digital/bounce/).

**NOTE!** This is still a work-in-progress!

### Description
An abstract music "sequencer" inspired by [Hanenbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BexGR0OQF) from the Nintendo DS game *Electroplankton*.

Written in p5.js.

Click in the space to generate a randomly moving ball that will bounce off the lines and the sides of the screen. When the ball bounces on a line, its position on the line will correspond to a note.

### Features to come
* Move and add/remove lines
* Parameters for gravity, inertia etc.
* Control over ball's initial speed (ie. pull back and release to launch)
* Remove each ball so things don't get too crowded
